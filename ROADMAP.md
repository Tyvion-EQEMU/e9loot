# e9loot Roadmap

## Not Yet Built — Backend Exists, No UI

These settings are fully wired in config.lua and the loot engine but have no controls in the main panel yet.

- **Trash Price** (`TrashPrice`) — sell any item worth >= this value in platinum; 0 = sell nothing. Needs a number input in the panel.
- **Warp Distance** (`WarpDist`) — max distance before warping to a corpse (0 = always warp). Needs a slider or input alongside Use Warp.
- **Loot Corpses** (`LootCorpses`) — toggle whether to loot corpses at all (master on/off for corpse looting vs. other loot sources). Needs a checkbox.
- **Loot Pets** (`LootPets`) — toggle whether to loot pet corpses. Needs a checkbox.
- **Loot Group** (`LootGroup`) — toggle whether to loot nearby group members' corpses. Needs a checkbox.
- **Announce Group** (`AnnounceGroup`) — broadcast loot events to group chat. Needs a checkbox.

## Not Yet Built — Weapon Mode Gaps

- **WeaponMode `always` / `never`** — exist in the upgrade engine but are not exposed in the panel dropdown. `always` = keep every equippable item regardless of stats; `never` = never keep gear upgrades. Worth adding to the Weapon Mode combo once we decide on display labels.

## Ideas / Not Yet Defined

- **Slot Exclusions / BIS Pinning** — Two related use cases:
  1. *Ignore a slot entirely* — user marks a slot (e.g. Waist) as off-limits and e9loot never evaluates or replaces whatever is equipped there. Useful for custom/server-specific items with abnormal stats that would otherwise get displaced by standard upgrade logic.
  2. *Pin a target item per slot* — user specifies a "best in slot" item name for a given slot. If that exact item is already equipped, the slot is locked and ignored. If it is not yet equipped, normal upgrade logic runs until the pinned item is found and equipped. Effectively pre-sets a gear goal per slot.
  - Open questions: where does this live in the UI (new tab in editor? per-slot config table in the panel?), how are slots identified to the user (slot name vs slot number), and how does it interact with WeaponMode filtering.

- **Deeper RGMercs Integration — Camp-Aware Looting** — Current framework pause stops pulls but does not stop RGMercs from running toons back to camp. With a small aggro radius and camphard off, this creates a loop: e9loot warps a toon to a corpse → RGMercs immediately runs them back to camp → loot never completes → repeat. The fix likely requires e9loot to do more than just pause before a loot sweep:
  1. Record the current camp location (RGMercs command TBD — needs research into what RGMercs exposes)
  2. Fully stop the camp (not just pause pulls) so toons stay where they are during looting
  3. Complete the loot sweep
  4. Re-establish the camp at the saved location
  5. Resume pulls
  - **Reference implementation**: `C:\games\mq-rekka\lua\rgmercs\modules\lootnscoot.lua` shows exactly how RGMercs integrates with an external loot script. The pattern: LNS is launched with `/lua run lootnscoot directed rgmercs`; RGMercs drives it each tick via `GiveTime()` using the MQ2 **Actors** messaging system (`Actors.register` / `actor:send`); RGMercs sends `{ directions='doloot' }` to trigger a sweep and blocks in `DoLooting()` waiting for a `done_looting` message back. e9loot could adopt the same `directed rgmercs` launch mode and Actors handshake. Note: the camp management problem is NOT solved in LNS — that would be new work on top of the directed mode pattern.

- **Diagnostics / Debug Output** — Beyond the loot history panel, more visibility would help when something unexpected happens or when onboarding new users. Ideas to consider: a verbose/debug toggle that echoes every item evaluation decision to a console or chat; a session stats summary (items kept/sold/destroyed, plat value of sold items, corpses looted); exporting loot history to CSV for review outside the game; a dedicated console window similar to LootNScoot's scrolling log panel; and possibly a `/e9loot debug` slash command to dump current config, list sizes, and script state in one shot. The existing per-character log file (`<Name>_e9loot.log`) is a start but isn't surfaced in the UI.

- **SellStuff / Restock / Bank** — Mirroring three LootNScoot features:
  - *SellStuff* — Walk to a vendor and sell everything in bags tagged as `sell`. LNS triggers this via `/lootnscoot sellstuff` which calls `processItems('Sell')`. Would need a merchant-proximity check, iteration over inventory, and `/sellitem` or equivalent commands.
  - *Restock* — After selling, buy back configured consumables (arrows, food, drink, potions) from the vendor. LNS calls this `processItems('Buy')` and drives it from a `BuyItems` list with a target quantity per item. Requires a separate "buy list" data structure.
  - *Bank* — Walk to a banker and deposit items tagged as `bank`. LNS uses `processItems('Bank')` and has a `BankTradeskills` toggle that auto-flags tradeskill items for banking. Would need bank-proximity detection and `/itemnotify` to bank slot targets.
  - All three would benefit from a `/e9loot sell`, `/e9loot restock`, `/e9loot bank` slash command as well as buttons in the panel. Integration with the existing `sell` decision in the loot engine is a natural starting point — items already tagged `sell` are in bags waiting to be sold.

## Maybe Someday

- **Server Profiles** — On first run (setup dialog), user selects their server from a dropdown. Each server ships with its own pre-populated loot lists (the `.txt` files backing the lua list system). Planned servers: Profusion EMU, Ascendant, Lazarus. A "Custom" option loads no pre-populated lists — blank slate for players on unlisted servers or those who want full manual control. Selecting a server would copy the appropriate list files into place; switching servers would require a decision on whether to overwrite existing lists or merge. This likely means duplicating the list file tree per server (e.g., `lists/profusion/`, `lists/ascendant/`, `lists/custom/`) and having the loader pick the right path based on the saved server setting.
